This console app can be used for testing custom ranking models in SharePoint Server 2010.

The app accepts the following parameters:

Site url - This is the URL that will be used  to connect to SharePoint (eg. http://mySharepointSite)
Query - This is the test query that will be executed using keyword query syntax (eg. testing isdocument:true)
Ranking model path - This optional parameter is the path to a custom ranking model to be used. (eg. c:\rankingmodel.xml)

Some examples usages:

Chaholl.RankingTester.exe "http://foo" "beetroot filetype:pdf" "c:\rankingmodels\test1.xml"

or

Chaholl.RankingTester.exe "http://foo" "beetroot filetype:pdf" 


The app will execute the given query once without the ranking model and again with the ranking model displaying the rank in both cases.
